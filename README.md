iOS-Projects-Catalogue
======================

This is my collection of iOS/Objective-C Open Source projects. I prefer keeping it in a separate repository to have a fast access to any projects I recently Github-starred or explored.

It will grow as fast as it is possible with my ability to add new projects I am already aware of and my ability to explore new projects around the net, Github, etc.

If you liked it, feel free to suggest any new projects that are not present in the current list.

Also I keep another catalogue of projects: it contains [the list of candidates for this catalogue](https://github.com/stanislaw/iOS-Projects-Catalogue/blob/master/Candidates.md. After I am sure enough that a particular candidate-project deserves its place here, I move it here from the list of Candidates.
